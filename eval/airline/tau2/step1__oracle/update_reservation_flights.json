However, it is not specific to ToolX since it applies broadly to all tools. It cannot be easily validated before invoking ToolX because the policy describes behavior during tool operations rather than specific preconditions. The policy is actionable since it describes a behavior pattern that can be enforced during tool usage. It's not fully self-contained as it assumes implicit knowledge about the broader coordination process, which might not be clear in isolation. The alternative description provides clarity and context missing in the original description.\nThe policy is relevant to the usage of the UpdateReservationFlights tool as it emphasizes the sequential invocation of tools and handling of user interactions, which is applicable when updating reservation flights. However, it is not specific to this tool alone; it applies to any tool usage scenario within the airline agent's role. It can be validated by checking logs for overlapping tool calls or simultaneous user responses. The policy is actionable by adhering to communication protocols of interaction. The policy is not self-contained because, while it lays out a specific procedure, it lacks details specific to the context within the entire tool operation framework. Thus, it could be improved with a more focused description relating specifically to the sequence of operation and interactions for clarity.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX (UpdateReservationFlights) as it coordinates the execution of tool operations, ensuring they are independent and sequential, which is vital for maintaining task order. However, the policy is broad because it applies to any tool, not just ToolX. Compliance can be validated by ensuring tool invocations and user responses do not overlap. The policy is actionable, as it guides agent behavior using existing parameters and procedures. The policy lacks self-containment because it references a practice (sequential tool calls) that requires contextual understanding from the policy document. An improved version provides clarity on its application without needing the additional context.\nThe policy is relevant to the tool 'UpdateReservationFlights', as it describes the protocol for invoking tools and interacting with users, which is essential for this tool's operation. However, the policy is not specifically tailored to ToolX alone, as it applies to any tool invocation and user interaction scenario, making it not tool-specific. The policy can be validated and is actionable with available parameters and communication protocols. It was not entirely self-contained because the explanation in its current form was too generic and would benefit from explicitly mentioning ToolX and the actions it pertains to, which led to providing an improved version. Overall, the policy's enforceability and clarity are strong, but the lack of tool-specific focus reduces its applicability slightly.\nThis policy is relevant to ToolX (UpdateReservationFlights) as it involves tool invocation. It is not tool-specific because it applies to all tools, not just UpdateReservationFlights, as mentioned in the reference passage. Validation can occur by checking tool logs and user response timestamps to ensure compliance. The policy is actionable since it involves clear operational steps concerning tool invocation and user communication. The description is self-contained, providing a clear and complete guidance without requiring additional context.\n"
