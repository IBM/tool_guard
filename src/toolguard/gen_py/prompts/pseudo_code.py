def tool_policy_pseudo_code(policy_item: ToolPolicyItem, fn_to_analyze: str, domain: Domain) -> str:
    """
    Returns a pseudo code to check business constraints on a tool cool using an API

    Args:
        policy_item (ToolPolicyItem): Business policy, in natural language, specifying a constraint on a process involving the tool under analysis.
        fn_to_analyze (str): The function signature of the tool under analysis.
        domain (Domain): Python code defining available data types and APIs for invoking other tools.

    Returns:
        str: A pseudo code descibing how to use the API to check the tool call

    * The available API functions are listed in the `domain.app_api.content`. 
    * Analyze the API functions' signatures (input and output parameter types).
    * You cannot assume other API functions.
    * For data objects (dataclasses or Pydantic models), only reference the explicitly declared fields.
        * Do not assume the presence of any additional fields.
        * Do not assume any implicit logic or relationships between field values (e.g., naming conventions).
    * List all the required API calls to check the business constraints.
    * If some information is missing, you should call another api function declared in the domain API.
