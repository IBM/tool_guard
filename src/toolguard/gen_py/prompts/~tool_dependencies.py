async def tool_dependencies(policy_item: ToolPolicyItem, tool_signature: str, domain: Domain) -> List[str]:
    """
Identify the names of other tools that the given tool relies on, according to its business policy.

Parameters:
    * policy_item (ToolPolicyItem): A natural-language business rule that specifies a constraint on how the tool under analysis should be used.
    * tool_signature (str): The toolâ€™s function signature, including its documentation and parameters.
    * domain (Domain): Python definitions of the available tool names (API function names) and their associated data types.

Output:
    * List[str]: A list of tool names that the analyzed tool depends on.

Implementation Guidelines:
    * A dependency exists if another tool must be called in order to enforce the given policy when invoking the tool under analysis.
    * Direct dependencies occur when a tool can be invoked directly to supply missing data, to transform or map the data, or to validate constraints.
    * Indirect dependencies may involve chains of calls, repeated invocations of the same tool, or comparisons between old and new states (e.g., when updating data).
        Examples of Indirect Dependencies:
        * Calling a validation API once per list item.
        * Fetching both the existing state and the new state when updates are involved (e.g., verifying a hotel reservation update requires both get_hotel_reservation and get_room_details).

Constraint:
    * A tool may only depend on immutable (read-only) tools.
