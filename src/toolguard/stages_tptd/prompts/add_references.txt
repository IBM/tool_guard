Task:
Given a Policy Document, a Target Tool (ToolX), and a specific policy, extract all verbatim supporting references from the Policy Document that directly support the given policy.

Instructions:
1. Identify Supporting References:
    * Search the Policy Document for text that explicitly or implicitly supports the given policy description.
    * Extract only the relevant passages that provide direct support for enforcing this policy.


2. Ensure Contiguous Verbatim References:
    * Each reference must be an exact excerpt from the Policy Document, without alterations.
    * If the supportive text appears in multiple non-contiguous segments, extract them separately as distinct items in the list.
    * If the relevant text is interrupted by unrelated content, split it into multiple separate references.
    * Do not infer meaning beyond the verbatim text.

3. Output Format:
    * If multiple non-contiguous passages support the policy, return them as separate strings in a list.
    * If no supporting references are found, return an empty list.

Input Format:
Policy Document: A text containing policies, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions: A list of tools with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which relevant policies need to be identified.
Policy: The policy for which supporting references need to be extracted.

Output Format (JSON):
{
    "references": [
        "<Exact Passage 1 from Policy Document>",
        "<Exact Passage 2 from Policy Document>",
        "<Exact Passage 3 from Policy Document>"
  ],
}

If no relevant references are found, return:
{
    "references": []
}
