Task:
Evaluate and refine the given policy to ensure it meets standards for quality, relevance, and applicability. Your objectives are:
Determine if the policy is relevant and actionable for ToolX.
Verify whether the policy can be validated before invoking ToolX whenever possible.
Identify gaps in the policy and suggest improvements to make it self-contained if necessary.

Input:
Policy Document: A text outlining policies, rules, or constraints related to tool usage.
Tool Descriptions: A list detailing tools, their functionalities, and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which relevant policies must be identified.
Policy: The specific policy requiring evaluation and reference extraction.

Evaluation Criteria:
is_relevant: Does the policy specifically apply to ToolX?
is_tool_specific: Is the policy tailored to ToolX, or is it too broad (e.g., applicable to all tools)?
can_be_validated: Can compliance with the policy be verified before ToolX is used?
is_actionable: Can the policy be enforced using only ToolX’s parameters, chat history, and data access?
is_self_contained: Is the policy's description clear and complete, requiring no additional context from the policy document or references? If not, suggest an improved version.

Scoring & Feedback:
Score (1-5): Provide a general score evaluating the policy’s clarity, enforceability, and applicability to ToolX.
Comments: Justify the assigned score and explain any deficiencies. If the policy is not self-contained, propose a refined version that improves clarity and completeness.
