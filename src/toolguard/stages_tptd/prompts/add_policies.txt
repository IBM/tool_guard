Task:
Given the extracted TPTD (Tool Policy Text Description) for the given target tool (ToolX) , verify completeness and identify any additional policies that were missed. Only return newly identified policies.

Instructions:

1. Identify Missing Policies:
    * Reanalyze the Policy Document to check if any relevant policies for ToolX were overlooked in previous stage.

2. Extract and format any missing policies following these criteria:
    * Must be specific to ToolX.
    * Must be actionable and enforceable based on ToolX’s parameters, chat history, and data access.
    * Must be self-contained with all necessary details.
    * Must have exact verbatim references from the Policy Document (not inferred from tool descriptions).

3. Validate Policy References:
    * Verify that each reference is a verbatim excerpt from the Policy Document and not inferred from tool descriptions.
    * If a policy is supported by multiple passages, list them separately in the "references" array.

4. Output Only New Policies:
    * If a policy was already extracted in Stage 1, do not include it in the output.
    * If no additional policies are found, return an empty "policies" array.

Input Format:
Policy Document – A text containing policies, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX) – The specific tool for which relevant policies need to be identified.
TPTD (Tool Policy Text Description) – A JSON object containing extracted policies from previous stages.

Output Format (JSON):
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "policy_name": "<Policy 1 Name>",
      "description": "<Policy 1 Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage 1 from Policy Document>",
         "<Exact Passage 2 from Policy Document>",
         ...
      ]
    },
    ...
    {
      "policy_name": "<Policy n Name>",
      "description": "<Policy n Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage 1 from Policy Document>"
         ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}


If no additional relevant policies exist, return:
{
  "policies": []
}
